# Using seperate repositories for each Terraform Module. An overview.

## Having Terraform modules in their own repositories offers several significant advantages, especially when managing infrastructure as code at scale. Here’s an overview of the benefits this approach provides:

	1.	Versioning: By storing Terraform modules in separate repositories, each module can be versioned independently. This allows for more granular control over updates and changes to modules. Teams can update the modules they depend on at their own pace, ensuring that they have tested and are comfortable with the changes. Versioning can follow semantic versioning principles, making it easier to understand the impact of updates.
	2.	Reusability: When modules are stored in their own repositories, it becomes easier for different projects or teams within an organization to discover and reuse these modules. This promotes the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency across your infrastructure.
	3.	Collaboration and Ownership: Having a dedicated repository for each module can clarify ownership and responsibility. It allows teams to focus on the modules relevant to their work and enables better collaboration through issues, pull requests, and code reviews specifically targeted at the infrastructure code.
	4.	Unit Testing: Storing Terraform modules in separate repositories facilitates unit testing of each module. Teams can write tests to verify that each module behaves as expected in isolation, improving code quality and reducing the risk of defects. Tools like Terratest can be used to write automated tests that help in validating the functionality of Terraform code.
	5.	CI/CD Integration: With modules in separate repositories, it’s easier to integrate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that automatically test, build, and release module versions. This can include linting, unit testing, and even deploying test instances of the infrastructure defined by the module to verify changes in a real-world scenario before they are released.
	6.	Documentation and Examples: Dedicated repositories allow for better documentation and example usage of modules. Each repository can include a README with detailed information about the module, how to use it, input variables, output values, and example configurations. This makes it easier for users to understand how to integrate the module into their projects.
	7.	Change Management: With version-controlled modules, it’s easier to track changes, review history, and roll back to previous versions if necessary. This can be crucial for troubleshooting issues or understanding the evolution of your infrastructure over time.
	8.	Security and Compliance: Separate repositories allow for more granular access control and auditing. You can restrict access to sensitive modules, enforce code review policies, and ensure that changes comply with your organization’s security and compliance standards.

In summary, using separate repositories for Terraform modules enhances modularity, reuse, and the overall management of infrastructure code. It facilitates better practices around versioning, testing, collaboration, and change management, leading to more robust and maintainable infrastructure as code practices.
